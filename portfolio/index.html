        <td> Library that parses a file with a particular XML-like formatting that contains information to put into a CV. The format is discussed in the README.md located in the repository. 
             After parsing, this information can be converted into two different file formats: a .html Jekyll compatible file or a .tex LaTeX file. </br> </br>

             The .html file is meant to be processed by Jekyll to create a web-page CV. I use this to make <a href = "{{site . url}}/cv/"> the webpage version of my CV </a>. </br> </br>

             The .tex LaTeX file is meant to be processed using <code>pdflatex</code> to create a .pdf version of the CV. I use this to make <a href = "{{site . url}}/cv/MatthewMcGonagleCV.pdf">the pdf version of my CV</a>. </br> </br>

        <td> Description </td>
        <td> The Hilbert curve is a space filling curve, i.e. a continuous curve that fills an entire square. The Hilbert curve is constructed using different levels of Hilbert pseudo-curves, which have a fractal-like self-similar nature. </br></br>
             The library turns a picture (e.g. a .png file) into a representation using one continuous non-self intersecting curve whose sections are different levels of Hilbert pseudo-curves. This works best for pictures of cartoon like subject that don't have too much detail. This best seen using an example picture. </br></br> 
             For example, consider the following (manually edited) cartoon-like picture of the mathematician David Hilbert and its conversion using the library: </br></br>
        <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthewMcGonagle/HilbertDraw/master/hilbertcartoon.png" alt = "Cartoon Picture of David Hilbert from the repository of the project." width = "49%" height = "400">
        <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthewMcGonagle/HilbertDraw/master/Outputbw.png" alt = "Conversion of cartoon Hilbert image." width = "49%" height = "400"> </br></br>
        The images have been resized for putting in this table. <a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthewMcGonagle/HilbertDraw/master/hilbertcartoon.png"> The fullsize cartoon image </a> and the <a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthewMcGonagle/HilbertDraw/master/Outputbw.png"> the fullsize conversion </a> are available inside the repository.
