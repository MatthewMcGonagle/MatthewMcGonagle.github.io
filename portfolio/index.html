        <td> Library that parses a file with a particular XML-like formatting that contains information to put into a CV. The format is discussed in the README.md located in the repository. 
             After parsing, this information can be converted into two different file formats: a .html Jekyll compatible file or a .tex LaTeX file. </br> </br>

             The .html file is meant to be processed by Jekyll to create a web-page CV. I use this to make <a href = "{{site . url}}/cv/"> the webpage version of my CV </a>. </br> </br>

             The .tex LaTeX file is meant to be processed using <code>pdflatex</code> to create a .pdf version of the CV. I use this to make <a href = "{{site . url}}/cv/MatthewMcGonagleCV.pdf">the pdf version of my CV</a>. </br> </br>

        <td> Do infinite precision arithmetic for numbers that are made of fractions and any number of square roots. 
             For example, numbers such as <code>1 + sqrt(1/2 + sqrt(2))</code>, where <code>sqrt()</code> is short for the square root function.

        <tr>
        <td> Description </td>
        <td> Handles arithmetic for numbers created from fractions by applying any number of square roots. For example, numbers such as <code>1 + sqrt(2)</code> or <code>1/3 + 2 * sqrt(1/2 + sqrt(2))</code>, where <code>sqrt()</code> is the square root function. </br></br>
             Library allows one to keep adding square roots of previously added numbers to perform operations. For example, the class starts off with handling only fractions. One could then add <code>sqrt(2)</code> to the numbers the class can handle; note that <code>sqrt(2)</code> is NOT a fraction (this is a math fact). Now the class can handle numbers like <code> 1/3 + 2/3 * sqrt(2) </code>. </br></br>
             You can then increase the numbers handled by the class by adding a new square root. For example, you could add <code>sqrt(1 + sqrt(2))</code>. Now the class can handle numbers such as <code> 1 + 3 * sqrt(1 + sqrt(2)) + 3/5 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 + sqrt(2))</code>. Note that the root we added, <code>sqrt(1 + sqrt(2))</code> isn't expressible in terms of the numbers previously handled by the class (again, another math fact). </br></br>
             The class can also determine if the square root of one the numbers it can handle can be expressed as a number it can already handle. For example, <code>sqrt(6 + 2 * sqrt(2)) = 2 + sqrt(2)</code>, so we don't need to add more numbers to the class to deal with <code>sqrt(6 + 2 * sqrt(2))</code>. When the class can find a square root in terms of numbers it already knows, then it is capable of telling you the square root.

        <tr>
        <td> Description </td>
        <td> The Hilbert curve is a space filling curve, i.e. a continuous curve that fills an entire square. The Hilbert curve is constructed using different levels of Hilbert pseudo-curves, which have a fractal-like self-similar nature. </br></br>
             The library turns a picture (e.g. a .png file) into a representation using one continuous non-self intersecting curve whose sections are different levels of Hilbert pseudo-curves. This works best for pictures of cartoon like subject that don't have too much detail. This best seen using an example picture. </br></br> 
             For example, consider the following (manually edited) cartoon-like picture of the mathematician David Hilbert and its conversion using the library: </br></br>
        <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthewMcGonagle/HilbertDraw/master/hilbertcartoon.png" alt = "Cartoon Picture of David Hilbert from the repository of the project." width = "49%" height = "400">
