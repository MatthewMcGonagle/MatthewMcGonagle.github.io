        <td> Description </td>
        <td> Library that parses a file with a particular XML-like formatting that contains information to put into a CV. The format is discussed in the README.md located in the repository. 
             After parsing, this information can be converted into two different file formats: a .html Jekyll compatible file or a .tex LaTeX file. </br> </br>

             The .html file is meant to be processed by Jekyll to create a web-page CV. I use this to make <a href = "{{site . url}}/cv/"> the webpage version of my CV </a>. </br> </br>

             The .tex LaTeX file is meant to be processed using <code>pdflatex</code> to create a .pdf version of the CV. I use this to make <a href = "{{site . url}}/cv/MatthewMcGonagleCV.pdf">the pdf version of my CV</a>. </br> </br>
