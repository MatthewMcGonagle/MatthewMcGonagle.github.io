## [Download the Source Code for this Post]({{site . url}}/assets/2017-11-08-LeetCode297.cpp)

In this post, I will discuss my solution for [Leet Code Problem 297: Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/description/). The purpose of this exercise is to implement two operations. First, take a binary tree of `int` variables, and represent it using a single `string`. Second, take a single `string` representing a binary tree of `int` variables (according to your own implementation), and then construct the binary tree of `int` variables it represents. At the time of submission, my solution was faster than 89.06% of all successfully submitted C++ solutions.

Let's take a look at how Leet Code solves this problem to allow users to input binary trees to test solutions to other problems. Consider the following binary tree:

![Pic of Simple Tree]({{site . url}}/assets/2017-11-08-simpleTree.svg)

Leet Code represents this tree in a breadth first traversal, using the string `'null'` for empty nodes, except for empty nodes after the last non-empty node. For details, you can see [this documentation provided by Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree). So, Leet Code represents this tree as `'[4,3,6,1,null,5,null,null,2]'`

However, my solution will not directly store empty nodes. Instead we will use the fact that we can replace the delimeters `','` with suffix characters representing information about how many and what type of children the node has. Similar to the Leet Code encoding, the nodes will be entered in a breadth first manner.

For the suffix characters, we will use:
* `'T'` to represent a node with two children.
* `'L'` to represent a node with only a left child.
* `'R'` to represent a node with only a right child. 
* `'E'` to represent a node with no children.

 Here 'E' can be thought to represent an 'ending' node; note that we can't use 'L' for leaf as we already used 'L' for only a left child. Furthermore, we will dispense with the initial character `'['`, but we will keep the final character `']'`.

So, in our system, the tree is represented as `'4T3L6L1R5E2E]'`. As you can readily see, this representation is significantly smaller than the Leet Code representation. It is less human readable, but our goal here is speed.

Before we get started, we'll need to include the following headers:
``` cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
#include<vector>
#include<queue>
#include<sstream>
#include<iostream>
```

Furthermore, Leet Code requires us to use the standard namespace:
``` cpp
using namespace std;
```

## Class Declarations for Our Solution

For the Leet Code solution, our tree nodes must be stored in the following `struct`:
``` cpp
/**
    Struct TreeNode is for holding node information. The format is specified by the Leet Code
    problem
*/
struct TreeNode {
    int val; // Value held at node
    TreeNode *left, *right; // Pointers to children.

    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};
```

Now let's look at the class holding our solution:
``` cpp
/**
    Class Codec is for serializing and deserializing the binary tree.

    The format of the string is that the nodes are entered in a breadth first traversal manner.
    Instead of using a single separator (such as a comma), we will use a suffix after each node
    value based on the type of children the node has. The letters are:
        'T' the node has two non-empty children.
        'L' the node has only a left non-empty child.
        'R' the node has only a right non-empty child.
        'E' the node has no children. Both of its children are null (i.e. empty). 
    The end of the tree is represented using the ']' character.
*/

class Codec {
    
    public:
       
        /** 
            Turns a tree into its string representation.
            
            @param root This is a pointer to the root node of the tree.
            @return The string representation of the tree.
        */ 
        string serialize(TreeNode* root); // Specified by Leet Code.

        /** 
            Turns a string into the binary tree it represents.
        
            @param data The string data is the representation of the tree.
            @return A pointer to the root node of the tree.
        */
        TreeNode* deserialize(string data); // Specified by Leet Code.
    
};
```
## Functions for Testing Our Solution

Before we get started with the implementations of the member of functions of `Codec`, we need some functions to help up test the correctness of our solution. This includes constructing our tree, printing it, and cleaning it up from memory when we are done. Note that we don't put any restrictions on the construction of our tree; it does NOT have to be a binary search tree, and it is allowed to contain repeated values.

``` cpp
// Functions for testing our solution.

/** 
    Builds a tree from a vector array of ints. However, a particular value of integer represents a null node (i.e. empty node). Note, this tree is NOT a binary search tree, and it is allowed to contain repeat values. Nodes are simply constructed in a breadth first manner using the order of the array.
    @param nums The array of numbers to use to construct the tree. The nodes are entered in a breadth first manner.
    @param nullVal Integers with the value nullVal will not be stored as full nodes. Instead, these indicate empty nodes, i.e. the end of a particular branch in the tree. 
*/
TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int> nums, int nullVal);

/**
    A simple print of the tree. Prints each level on a separate line.
    @param root This variable points to the root node of the tree.
*/
void printTree(TreeNode* root);

/**
    Deletes a tree from memory.
    @param root This variable points to the root node of the tree.
*/ 
void deleteTree(TreeNode* root);
```

## Serializing the Binary Tree

Now we define the function `Codec::serialize`. We enter the nodes in a breadth first manner using a `queue<TreeNode *>`. As we serialize each node, we look at which of its children are non-null to determine which suffix character we need to add.

``` cpp
string Codec::serialize( TreeNode* root ) {

    ostringstream ss;
    queue<TreeNode*> toProcess; // holds node needed to be processed.
    TreeNode *current;

    // Case of empty tree.

    if(root == NULL)
        return string("]");

    // We will traverse the nodes in a breadth first manner.

    toProcess.push(root);

    while(!toProcess.empty()) {

        current = toProcess.front();
        toProcess.pop();

        ss << current -> val;
        
        // Determine the suffix for the node value based on the node's children. 

        if (current -> left != NULL && current -> right != NULL){ 
            ss << 'T';
            toProcess.push(current -> left);
            toProcess.push(current -> right);
        }
        else if (current -> left != NULL) { 
            ss << 'L';
            toProcess.push(current -> left);
        }
        else if (current -> right != NULL) {
            ss << 'R';
            toProcess.push(current -> right);
        }
        else 
            ss << 'E';
        
    }

    // Mark the end of the tree.

    ss << ']';

    return ss.str();   
}
```

## Function to Deserialize the Binary Tree

Now let's define `Codec::deserialize`, the function to turn a string representation into a tree. As we parse
the string, we add pointers to the queue `queue<TreeNode**> parents`. Now, why do we use a queue of **double** pointers? This is so we can simply point to either the left or right child of the parent without having to pass more information; this keeps everything simple.

Note, each node has only one parent. So we will have that the front of the queue always hold the correct child of the correct parent for the current node as we traverse the tree in a breadth first manner.

```cpp
TreeNode* Codec::deserialize(string data) {

    TreeNode *root, *newNode, **newParent;
    queue<TreeNode**> parents; // Holds pointer to parents child pointer to assign to current node.
                               // Using double pointers to allow putting left and right children
                               // in the same queue. Keeps everything much more simple.
    stringstream ss(data); // For parsing string.
    int val;
    char nodeType; // Suffix type of node.

    // Case of Empty String.
    if(data.size() == 0)
        return NULL;

    // Check to see if string represents empty tree.
    if(ss.peek() == ']')
        return NULL;

    // Set up the initial root.

    ss >> val;
    ss >> nodeType;
    root = new TreeNode(val);
    newNode = root;

    if (nodeType == 'T') {
        parents.push(&(newNode -> left));
        parents.push(&(newNode -> right));
    }
    else if (nodeType == 'L') 
        parents.push(&(newNode -> left));
    else if (nodeType == 'R') 
        parents.push(&(newNode -> right));

    // Now construct the rest of the tree while we haven't reached the end of the tree.

    while (ss.peek() != ']') {

        ss >> val;
        ss >> nodeType;
        
        newNode= new TreeNode(val);
        
        // Front of parents queue (which must be non-empty as this node must have a parent) holds
        // a pointer to which child (left or right) this node is relative to its parent.
        if(!parents.empty()) {
            newParent = parents.front();
            parents.pop();
            *newParent = newNode;
        }
       
        // Use the suffix of this node to figure out which child pointer(s) to load into parents queue. 

        if (nodeType == 'T') {
            parents.push(&(newNode -> left));
            parents.push(&(newNode -> right));
        }
        else if (nodeType == 'L') 
            parents.push(&(newNode -> left));
        else if (nodeType == 'R') 
            parents.push(&(newNode -> right));

    } 

    return root;
}
```

## The Test Functions

Now we define the functions necessary for testing our solution. These functions are pretty standard, and they aren't absolutely necessary to understand in detail. However, for completeness we still provide their definition.

``` cpp
// Build a tree from an array of numbers. Use nullVal to indicate empty nodes.

TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int> nums, int nullVal) {

    TreeNode *root, *current;
    queue<TreeNode*> leafnodes; // A queue of the current leaf nodes to add children too.
    vector<int>::iterator iT = nums.begin() + 1;

    if (nums.size() == 0)
        return NULL;

    root = new TreeNode(nums[0]);
    leafnodes.push(root);

    // For each loop, we try to add both a left and right child. So, we try to add two nodes
    // for each pass. Except the case of nullVal.

    while(iT != nums.end()) {

        current = leafnodes.front();
        leafnodes.pop();

        // Look at adding left child.

        if(*iT != nullVal) {
            current -> left = new TreeNode(*iT);
            leafnodes.push(current -> left);
        }
        iT++;

        // Look at adding right child.

        if(iT != nums.end()) {
       
            if(*iT != nullVal) { 
                current -> right = new TreeNode(*iT);
                leafnodes.push(current -> right);
            }
            iT++;
        } 
    }

    return root;
    
}

void printTree(TreeNode* root) {

    // Use two queues. At any given time one queue holds nodes to print on current
    // level while other holds values on next level.

    queue<TreeNode*> toPrintA, toPrintB;
    queue<TreeNode*> *toPrintNow, *toPrintNext, *swapper;
    TreeNode* current;

    if(root == NULL) {
        cout << "NULL";
        return;
    }

    toPrintNow = &toPrintA;
    toPrintNext = &toPrintB;    
    toPrintNow -> push(root);

    while(!toPrintNow -> empty()) {

        current = toPrintNow -> front();
        toPrintNow -> pop();

        if(current == NULL)
            cout << "NULL, ";
        else {
            cout << current -> val << ", ";
            toPrintNext -> push(current -> left);
            toPrintNext -> push(current -> right);
        }

        if(toPrintNow -> empty()) {
            // Swap pointer values.
            swapper = toPrintNow;
            toPrintNow = toPrintNext;
            toPrintNext = swapper;
            cout << endl; 
        }

    } 
    
}

// Traverse the tree in a breadth first manner using a queue inorder to free the nodes from memory.

void deleteTree(TreeNode* root) {

    queue<TreeNode*> toDelete;
    TreeNode *current;

    if(root == NULL)
        return;
    
    toDelete.push(root);
    while(!toDelete.empty()) {
        
        current = toDelete.front();
        toDelete.pop();

        if ( current -> left != NULL )
            toDelete.push( current -> left );
        if ( current -> right != NULL )
            toDelete.push( current -> right );
        
        delete current;
    }
}
```

## Testing Our Solution

Now let's look at the main executable to test our solution.
``` cpp
/**
    The main executable function. This is used to test our solution before submitting to Leet Code.
*/
int main() {

    int nullVal = -100,
        numsArray[] = {1, 2, 10, 3, -100, 5, 6, 3, 1, -100, 2, 4, -100, 6};
    vector<int> nums = vector<int>(numsArray, numsArray + sizeof(numsArray) / sizeof(int));
    TreeNode *root, *deserialized;
    Codec codec;
    string serialization;

    // Construct the tree. Print it to see that it works.
    root = buildTree(nums, nullVal);
    printTree(root);

    // Now test the codec serialization and deserialization.

    cout << "Now let's print the serialization of the tree." << endl;
    serialization = codec.serialize(root);
    cout << serialization << endl;

    cout << "Now let's test the deserialization of this string." << endl;
    deserialized = codec.deserialize(serialization); 
    printTree(deserialized);

    // Clean up.

    deleteTree(root);
    deleteTree(deserialized);
    return 0;
}
```
After we construct the tree, when we print it, we get the following output.
```
1,
2, 10,
3, NULL, 5, 6,
3, 1, NULL, 2, 4, NULL,
6, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
NULL, NULL,
```
Just to be clear, this tree is the following:

![Pic of test tree.]({{site . url}}/assets/2017-11-08-test.svg)

For the serialization, of this tree, we get the following result:
```
Now let's print the serialization of the tree.
1T2L10T3T5R6L3L1E2E4E6E]
```

For the deserialization of this string, we get the following output:
```
1,
2, 10,
3, NULL, 5, 6,
3, 1, NULL, 2, 4, NULL,
6, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
NULL, NULL,
```

So, we see that they match.
