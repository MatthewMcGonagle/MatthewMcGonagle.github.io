In this post we will explore using solutions to the travelling salesman problem to create images that are drawn with a single closed curve; for a 
true solution to the travelling salesman problem, this curve will not cross itself. However, we will be using the method of simulated annealing to
find approximate solutions to the travelling salesman problem. So our curves will have some self-crossings, but the number of crossings
shouldn't be too large.
